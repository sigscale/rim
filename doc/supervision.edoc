@doc This {@link //stdlib/supervisor. supervisor} behaviour callback
	module implements a supervisor in the
	{@link //sigscale_fm. sigscale_fm} application.

The supervision heirachy is depicted in
<a href="supervision.png">Figure 1-1</a> as a directed graph starting
from the top. The {@link //stdlib/supervisor. supervisor} behaviour
nodes are depicted as blue boxes while
{@link //stdlib/gen_server. gen_server} and {@link //stdlib/gen_fsm. gen_fsm}
behaviours are depicted as yellow and green ovals respectively.  The edge
(line) between nodes is labeled with the number of identical nodes which may
exist (<tt>N</tt> indicates any number).  The node label for child workers
indicates when they will be restarted (<tt>permanent</tt>, <tt>temporary</tt>
or <tt>transient</tt>).  Node labels provide the name of the callback module
implementing the behaviour.  For supervisors the <tt>sup_flags()</tt> are
also provided as
<tt>{RestartStrategy::strategy(), Intensity::integer(), Period::integer()}</tt>.
